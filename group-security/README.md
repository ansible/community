# Security Working Group

The Security Working Group focuses on delivering modules and features to
Ansible to support working with Security Platforms.

## Meetings

We are holding a weekly community meeting at #ansible-security IRC channel
at **15:00 UTC every Monday**. The IRC channel is the main and official
place to contact the members. For specific issues and feature requests,
follow the standard Ansible issues/PRs workflow.

## Working Group Goals

* [Review PRs and Issues](review.md) with a view to reducing the number of
  open PRs and Issues. Numbers going up is not a failure, it might just be
  due to additional contributors.
* [Unit tests](unit.md) - all Security modules should have unit tests to
  sanity check the developer's code and code completion.
* [Integration tests](integration.md) - all Security modules should have
  integration tests so that we can update them with confidence that we won't
  break other people's stuff.
* [Best practices](bestpractices.md) - all modules should meet the Ansible
  best practices, such as python coding standards, and ansible best practices
  documentation.

## Collaboration

Apart from IRC The Security Working Group collaborates via tickets and pull
requests in the main Ansible repository.

## Archiving this repository

We are phasing out this repository in favor of more dedicated repositories under the governance of the
Ansible community. Consider this repository content as read-only except for critical meeting updates.

This section lists where to go for updated content and will be updated as we progress:

* For presentations (formerly the `/decks` ) directory - See [ansible-community/presentations](https://github.com/ansible-community/presentations)
* For Working group meetings (formerly the `/meetings` directory) - see the new  [meeting ICS calendar}(https://forum.ansible.com/g)
and  [Ansible working groups](https://forum.ansible.com/g).


## Working Groups

Working groups are moving to the [Ansible community forum](https://forum.ansible.com/tags/c/project/7/meeting).

The remainder of this section is older information that will be removed when the conversion to the forum is completed.

* [All Ansible Working Groups](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki)

This repository is for management of all Ansible community related initiatives.

We help to support and grow Ansible's community of contributors in their efforts to improve Ansible code, content, outreach, and user and contributor experiences.

This repository serves as a space for the Ansible Community Working Group to manage tools used by the Ansible community, monitor progress on new initiatives, and handle requests for resources or help by various Working Groups in the wider Ansible community.

## Our Goals

* Encourage transparency, collaboration, and accountability through tooling and project tracking and/or management.
* Assist working groups in the Ansible community for our mutual success.
* Facilitate the creation of new initiatives and working groups.
* Do all of this by KEEPING THINGS SIMPLE (just like Ansible!).

## Infrastructure and processes we build and/or support

* [Ansible Community Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/): Official Ansible Discourse forum.
* [Meetings](https://github.com/ansible/community/tree/main/meetings): Matrix/IRC meeting-related infrastructure, including the meeting bot and space for logs; organization of Ansible Contributor Summits.
* [Bullhorn](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn): Ansible contributor newsletter.
* [Collection Bot](https://github.com/ansible-community/collection_bot): Automation of GitHub issue/pull request processing for ansible collections.

## Groups

  * [On the Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/g) (recommended)
  * [As wiki pages](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki) in this repository (deprecated)

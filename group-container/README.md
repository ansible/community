# Container Working Group

Focused on improving Ansible's ability to build and orchestrate containers. In addition to the Ansible project, also includes
the [Ansible Container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container) project, and the [OpenShift Restclient Python](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python) project for generating Ansible K8s modules.

## Collaboration

For Ansible and Ansible Container work, we coordinate through issues and pull requests as much as possible. If you have a question, or want to get involved, join us on the [#ansible-container](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ansible-container) channel at irc.freenode.net.

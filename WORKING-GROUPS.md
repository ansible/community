# Creating an Ansible Working Group

## What are Working Groups


Working Groups are a way for Ansible community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest.

The basic components of a working group:
* A group name and charter (why the group exists);
* A registered IRC channel on freenode (will usually be #ansible-groupname);
* A group of users (at least two!) who will be driving the agenda of the working group;
* Dedicated wiki space.

The basic responsibilities of a working group:
* Be responsive on your IRC channel;
* Report semi-regularly on the cool stuff that your working group is working on;
* Keep your wiki space clean!

## Requesting a Working Group

Anyone can request to start a Working Group, for any reason. 

Cut and paste the following text into an [Community Issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/new), and replace the examples in brackets
with your own working group info:

```
WORKING GROUP NAME:    [ Example: unicorn   ]

WORKING GROUP PURPOSE:
[ Example: This working group is to review  ]
[ all Unicorn-related modules               ]
[                                           ]
(keep it short and sweet)

AT LEAST TWO INITIAL WORKING GROUP MEMBERS:
[ IRC: gregdek / GitHub: @gregdek           ]
[ IRC: rbergeron / GitHub: @robynbergeron   ]
[                                           ]
(provide the IRC nicks AND GitHub IDs of your working group members, one name per line please)
```

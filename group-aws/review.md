# Review open PRs and Issues

Numbers going up is not a terrible sign, it
might be due to more contributors, but would be
good to get some idea of trend

The migration of issues/PRs from ansible-modules-core and
ansible-modules-extras will have a big impact on numbers
for mid September 2017 onwards, but also helps genuinely reflect
the number of issues and PRs.

There are some discrepancies below with the numbers (you expect
number of open issues to change by the sum of open and closed issues
in the month). One explanation might be issues opened longer ago
than a month but labelled with AWS in the last month. There may
be a better explanation though (one such is that I was undercounting
opened issues by ignoring issues that had been opened but since closed,
but discrepancies still exist).

# Review open PRs and Issues

Numbers going up is not a terrible sign, it
might be due to more contributors, but would be
good to get some idea of trend

The migration of issues/PRs from ansible-modules-core and
ansible-modules-extras will have a big impact on numbers
for mid September 2017 onwards, but also helps genuinely reflect
the number of issues and PRs.
